#  TandemQuiz
### A quiz app I built as a code challenge


A basic quiz game app using a JSON file from Tandem. The app randomly selects from the twenty or so questions in the JSON file and presents ten to the user. To advance, a user must answer each question from the answers, whose order on the screen is randomized each time the question appears on screen. At the end, the users score is presented to them and the option to start over and try those same ten questions again.

to run the app:

- Clone this repo down to a local machine.
- Make sure you are running Xcode 11.6 (11E708).
- Make sure you are have Swift 5.2.4 installed (in terminal run this command to check: `swift --version`).
- Build and run the app (`âŒ˜-R` in Xcode)
- enjoy!
